geschreven als een onbekommerd liedje, volgens sommigen een van de meest deprimerende dingen die ze ooit gelezen

doet me denken aan Greg McEwan die een essay moest schrijven over zijn vaders boek Enduring love:
*"A Romantic scholar [Clarissa], she doubts his evidence that he is being stalked, and nearly ends up dead. McEwan remembers that not every reader accepted the point: “Poor Greg had to study ‘Enduring Love’ in school. He had a female teacher. And he had to write an essay: Who was the moral center of the book? And I said to Greg, ‘Well, I think Clarissa’s got everything wrong.’ He got a D. The teacher didn’t care what I thought. She thought that Joe was too ‘male’ in his thinking. Well. I mean, I only wrote the damn thing.*"" (Uit ‘The Background Hum. Ian McEwan’s art of unease.’ Door Daniel Zalewski in The New Yorker, 23 februari 2009).
